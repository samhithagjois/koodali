My project for the NKS kids so they don't have to submit their stuff on whatsapp anymore. The name is inspired by "Moodle" and is the name of a city in Karnataka where the Tunga and the Bhadra merge, and also means "Merge". 

Sooo here is the plan : 
1. It will be something like moodle but very very simple. The login is done with the student/teachers's ID and the password will be a combination of the country, birth date, the name of the class they are teaching/assigned to/ or Administration and a special emoji combo of their liking so something like DE13327102004Sharavati<3, NL00105052016Tunga_@_, or DE10007121987Admin&&.
2. Then that takes them to the site. It is strictly for homework submission, exchange and download.
3. The students have following view : View Pending Assignments | View Submitted Assignments | View Graded Assignments
4. The teachers have following view : Upload Assignment  | View Ungraded Assignments | View Graded Assignments | Student Overview
5. So the workflow is :
    -> Teacher uploads assignment A for class B
    -> all students of class B get A added to their Pending Assignments Tab, and the teacers Student Overview shows "assigned, not read"
    -> Then They click on the pdf file or read the assignment and mark the assignment as read by pressing a little button on the side
    -> This triggers the teacher's Student Overview, which marks it as "read, not submitted"
    -> Then they do the homework
    -> They then go to the assignment in the pending assignment tab and click on the submit button, which takes them to the upload site
    -> There, they upload their homework, if needed, they change the name to a certain format, and click upload
    -> This triggers following actions : a) removes A from Pending Assignments, b)add student's A to teacher's Ungraded Assignments, and Student Overview, where the status changes to "submitted, not graded"
    -> The teacher goes to View Ungraded Assignments, downloads the assignment, and grades it
    -> The teacher presses the "Grade" button on the View Ungraded Assignment page which takes them to the grading upload site
    -> There, they upload their graded assignment or just leave a text and a score
    -> This triggers the following actions : a) delete A from teachers' View Ungraded Assignment b) add graded A to student's View Graded Assignments c)Student Overview, which now shows "graded"
    -> The student can download it and/or mark the grading as read, which triggers the teachers Student Overview yet again and changes the status to "graded and recieved".

6. The student overview lets teachers see a list of their students that they teach and/or Co-teach
7. Maybe once I am done with this I'll add a classwork section? Which is strictly upload - download? Maybe should I even start with that first??? Omg yeah wait let me make life easier for me
